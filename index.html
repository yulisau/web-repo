    <h4>Who am I?</h4>
    <p>Hi! My name is Yuliza Saucedo and I'm a third year CTD major and business minor student. I was born in Denver, CO but raised in Aurora, CO. My hobbies include doing different arts & crafts, playing tennis, and going to concerts. My interest in graphic design started my junior year of high school when I took a digital development class. My favorite topic in that class was web design so I'm excited to explore it more in this class.</p>
